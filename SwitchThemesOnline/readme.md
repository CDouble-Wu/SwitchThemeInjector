This is a new version of the web injector built entirely from scratch, the old code is available till [commit c8d77a4](https://github.com/exelix11/SwitchThemeInjector/commit/c8d77a48235eb18bb93343617a969c57b55ccd6f)

# Building
Building the new web injector requires visual studio 2019 preview and .net core 3 preview 6.
It's recommended to unload the repo if you're using non-preview visual studio
